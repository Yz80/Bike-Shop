# Project Background
The Bike Shop project aims to analyze profitability and customer demographics over time, focusing on identifying key hours, days, and seasons of profitability. The project also investigates customer types (registered vs. casual riders) and their contribution to revenue. The dataset includes data on riders, sales, and seasonal trends for 2021 and 2022, and KPIs such as profit margin, revenue, and profit are tracked. This project provides insights to optimize business strategies and identify high-performing time slots and customer segments for better decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1: Profitability by Hour and Day** 
- **Category 2: Seasonality and Revenue Trends** 
- **Category 3: Demographics and Customer Segments** 
- **Category 4: Business Recommendations for Optimization** 



# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

The analysis showed that the Bike Shop experiences higher sales in midday and early evening hours, especially between 10 AM and 3 PM, with Wednesday and Friday being particularly profitable. Sales trends are also significantly influenced by seasonality, with summer (season 3) producing the highest revenue. Rider demographics indicate that a large portion of revenue comes from registered riders (80%), while casual riders contribute 20%.

# Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the [stakeholder team] to consider the following: 

* Optimize operating hours. Reduce operational hours during early mornings and late evenings to save on costs while focusing on peak hours for maximum profitability.**
  
* Focus on seasonal marketing. Leverage the summer months by increasing promotional activities and stocking high-demand items, as season 3 is the most profitable period.**
  
* Enhance rider engagement. Invest in loyalty programs and exclusive offers for registered users, who account for 80% of revenue, while creating seasonal offers to attract more casual riders.**
  
* Strategic promotions during peak days. Offer targeted promotions on Wednesdays and Fridays, as these days consistently show higher sales across both years.**
  


# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1: The relationship between weather and sales was not directly analyzed, but it is assumed that weather conditions impact seasonality trends, particularly the decline in sales during winter months.
  
* Assumption 2: Registered riders are assumed to renew subscriptions annually based on historical patterns, but future subscription renewal rates may vary.
  
* Assumption 3: Casual rider behavior was analyzed on aggregate, and future marketing efforts may need to focus more granularly on specific casual rider segments (e.g., weekend-only users or tourists).
